# Assignment

This project is about setting up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a basic Node.js "Hello World" web app. I used Jenkins as the CI/CD tool, Docker for containerization, AWS ECR to store images, and an EC2 instance for the staging environment.

The goal was to automate the entire process â€” from building the app to testing, containerizing, and deploying it to staging.
